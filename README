Bio::Das::Lite
==============


Bio::Das::Lite is an implementation of the BioDas protocol, http://biodas.org/
for the retrieval of biological data from XML sources over HTTP.

Bio::Das::Lite is designed as a lightweight and more forgiving alternative to
the client/retrieval/parsing components of Bio::Das. Bio::Das::Lite itself is
not a drop-in replacement for Bio::Das but it can be subclassed to do so
(and probably will in a short-term future release).


NOTE
Results are returned hashed against the query URL which caused them.
This means that sometimes you receive more results than you might expect
(number of sources * number of segments)
