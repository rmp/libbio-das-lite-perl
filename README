Bio::Das::Lite
==============

Bio::Das::Lite is an implementation of the BioDas protocol, http://biodas.org/
for the retrieval of biological data from XML sources over HTTP.

Bio::Das::Lite is designed as a lightweight and more forgiving alternative to
the client/retrieval/parsing components of Bio::Das. Bio::Das::Lite itself is
not a drop-in replacement for Bio::Das but it can be subclassed to do so.


NOTE
Results are returned hashed against the query URL which caused them.
This means that sometimes you receive more results than you might expect
(number of sources * number of segments)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

WWW::Curl
HTTP::Response
English
Carp
Readonly

Please note that some elements of HTTP proxy support require that WWW::Curl has been built from a minimum version of the libcurl C library:
  authenticating proxies: 7.19.1
  noproxy (proxy exclusion lists): 7.19.4
If you have an earlier version installed, you will not be able to use these features of Bio::Das::Lite. Regular proxy support should be unaffected.
