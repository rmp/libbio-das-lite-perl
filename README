Bio::Das::Lite
==============

WARNING: see below for details of incompatible dependencies currently affecting
         Bio::Das::Lite.

Bio::Das::Lite is an implementation of the BioDas protocol, http://biodas.org/
for the retrieval of biological data from XML sources over HTTP.

Bio::Das::Lite is designed as a lightweight and more forgiving alternative to
the client/retrieval/parsing components of Bio::Das. Bio::Das::Lite itself is
not a drop-in replacement for Bio::Das but it can be subclassed to do so
(and probably will in a short-term future release).


NOTE
Results are returned hashed against the query URL which caused them.
This means that sometimes you receive more results than you might expect
(number of sources * number of segments)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

LWP::Parallel::UserAgent
SOAP::Lite is required for non-DAS/2 registry support

WARNING: recent versions of LWP (libwww-perl) break LWP::Parallel, the core
         dependency of Bio::Das::Lite. At the time of writing (14th Nov 2008)
         this affects all versions of LWP from 5.816 (currently upto 5.820).
         There is no fix. It is recommended to use the last known working
         version: libwww-perl-5.814.
